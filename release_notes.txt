h1. <span>2010-02-07</span> Release 0.1.0

h2. Initial release

h3. Features

* Can add multiple files/directories to the file list
* Directories recursively followed to add common video formats
* All files in the list get successfully renamed from old name to new name

h4. Bugs / Known Problems / To do

* Not all common downloaded TV Show formats parsed correctly
* It will rename files it does not recognize (so make sure you remove them from the file list)
* I do not look up episode info from TVDB so episode names are not yet added
** The code for this exists in my ruby version, though (http://github.com/bjeanes/tv-renamer)
